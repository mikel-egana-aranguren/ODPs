ONTOLOGY DESIGN PATTERNS PUBLIC CATALOG

This is the downloadable version of the catalog found in:
http://odps.sourceforge.net

The core of the catalog is the collection of OWL files (owl/), each file describing an ODP.
The catalog is generated by a little program (bin/generate_catalog.sh) and the result is 
the collection of HTML files (html/). To add a new ODP, simply create an OWL ontology that 
describes it under owl/, following any of the provided examples. The program that generates
the catalog is very fragile so try to stick as much as possible to the examples.
